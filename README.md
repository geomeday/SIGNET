# Documentation for SIGNET streamline project

## Getting started 
First you should clone the directory to your path in server and add the path you installed the software to enable directly running the command without specifying a particular path.
```bash
git clone https://github.itap.purdue.edu/jiang548/SIGNET.git
cd SIGNET
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/signet
```
where */path/to/signet* should be replaced with your path to *SIGNET*.

## Requirement
1. This package runs on UNIX bash shell. Check your shell with "echo $SHELL" to make sure that you are running on UNIX bash shell.
2. This package assumes you are using the **Slurm Workload Manager** for supercomputers in the network analysis stage.  
3. This pacakge assumes you have singularity installed if you would like to use the container image that described below. If you are using the linux system, you could install singularity following https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps. If you are a windows/mac user, you could find the installation guide in https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/admin-guide/installation.html. You could also choose to skip the container, and instead install all the packages required mannually. 


## Container image
1. The Singularity Image Format file **signet.sif** comes with all the required pacakges for *SIGNET*, and an environment that *SIGNET* could run smoothly in. You could first pull the image from Sylabs Cloud Library and rename it as "signet.sif", after which you could append the path of package to singularity so it could execute *SIGNET* smoothly.
```bash
singularity pull signet.sif library://geomeday/default/signet:0.0.4.sif
export SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH="/path/to/signet"
```
where */path/to/signet* should be replaced with your path to *SIGNET*.

2. You could use the image by attaching a prefix ahead of the original commands you want to execute, which are described in details in sections below.
```bash
singularity exec signet.sif [Command]

e.g. 
singularity exec signet.sif signet -s 
```
Or you could first shell into the container by  
```bash 
singularity shell signet.sif
```
and then execute all the commands as usual.

**Caution**  
All the intermediate result for each step will by default return to the corresponding folders in the tmporary directory starting with 'tmp' and all the final result will return to the result folders starting with 'res'.  You could also change the path of result files in the configuration file named config.ini, or use signet -s described below. Please be careful if you are using the relative path instead of the absolute path. The config.ini will record the path relative to the folder the **signet is installed**, in order to reach file mangement consistency. It's highly recommended to run command where signet is installed.  In each of the process, you could specify the result path, and you will be asked to whether purge the tmporary files, if you already have those. It's also suggested you keep a copy of the temporary files for each analysis, in case you need them in later steps.


## Introduction

This streamline project provide users easy linux user interface for constructing whole-genome gene regulatory networks using transciptomic data (from RNA sequence) and genotypic data. 

Procedures of constructing gene regulatory networks can be split into six main steps:
1. genotype preprocess
2. gene expression preprocess
3. adjust for covariates 
4. cis-eQTL analysis
5. network analysis
6. network visualization

To use this streamline tool, user need first to prepare the genetype data in vcf format. Then set the configuration file properly, and run each step command seperately.

## Quit Start

#### 1. Prepare the DataSet

We highly recommand you to prepare the gene expression data and genotype data first, and place them to a specific data folder, to organize each step as it may involve many files:

[Click here](#data-format) for more detail about genotype and genexpression dataset

#### 2. Set configuration 

Here we set the number of chromosomes to 22

**1.** 
```bash
signet -s --nchr 22
```

We can use the command to check below to check chromosome number
```bash
signet -s --nchr
```
That is, when no value is provided, we will display the value of the specified parameter. We can also use 
```bash
signet -s
```
to display the values of all parameters. We may also provide a way to reset the value of one parameter or all parameters to default values.
```bash
signet -s --d
```
or 
```bash
signet -s --nchar --d
```

#### 3. Genotype Preprocess

For preprocessing genotype data
```bash
signet -g
```



#### 4. Genexpression Preprocess


For preprocessing transcriptomic (gene expression) data
```bash
signet -t
```


#### 5. cis-eQTL Analysis

For cis-eQTL analysis

I would suggest to take
```bash
signet -c
```



#### 6. Network Analysis

For network construction.
```bash
signet -n 
```


#### 7. Network Visualization
For network visualization.
```bash
signet -v 
```

## Command Guide

*Please note that you have to run genotype preprocessing before gene expression preprocessing if you are using the GTEx cohort*

### Settings

Settings command is used for look up and modify parameter in the configuration file config.ini. You don't have to modify the parameters at the very beginning, as you will have options to change your input parameters in each step. 

[click here](#config-file) for detailed introduction for configuration file. 

#### Usage
```bash
signet -s [--PARAM] [PARAM VAL] 
```


#### Description
```bash
    --PARAM                                      list the value of parameter PARAM
    --PARAM [PARAM VAL]      modify the value of parameter PARAM to be [PARAM VAL]
```


#### Example
```bash
# list all the parameters
signet -s 
## echo: all the current parameters

# List the paramter
signet -s --nchr
## echo: 22

# Replace s with settings would also work
signet -settings --nchr 

# Modify the paramter
signet -s --nchr 22
## echo: Modification applied to nchr

# Set all the parameters to default 
signet -s --d 
## echo: Set all the parameters to default 
```

#### Error input handling 
```bash
# If you input wrong format such as "-nchr"
signet -s -nchr
echo: The usage and description instruction.

# If you input wrong name such as "-nchro"
echo: Please check the file name
```



### Transcript-prep 
(TCGA)

- `matched.geno` : matched genotype file from previous step
- `gene.pos` : gene position file


The results of `cis-eqtl` are output in to the following files, and they are all saved under  `res/resc/cis-eQTL`:

* `net.Gexp.data`: is the expression data for genes;
* `net.genepos`: include the position for genes in `net.Gexp.data`;
* `[common|low|rare|all].eQTL.data`: includes the genotype data for marginally significant [ common | low | rare | all ] cis-eQTL;

### network

`network` command provide the tools for constructing a gene regulatory network (GRN) following the two-stage penalized least squares (2SPLS) approach proposed by [D. Zhang, M. Zhang, Ren, and Chen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00370).

`network` receive the input from the previous step:

**All of the following files has to be put under the directory /data/network

* `net.Gexp.data`: output from `cis-eqtl`, is the expression data for genes with cis-eQTL:  
* `all.eQTL.data`: output from `cis-eqtl`, includes the genotype data for marginally significant  cis-eQTL:  
* `all.sig.pValue_0.05`: output from `cis-eqtl`,includes the $p$-value of each pair of gene and its marginally significant (p-Value < 0.05) cis-eQTL, where Column 1 is Gene Index (in `net.Gexp.data`), Column is SNP Index (in `all.Geno.data`), and Column 3 is p-Value.
 
The final output files of `network` will be saved under `/res/network/resn`:
* `adjacency_matrix`: the adjancency matrix for the estimated regulatory effects;
* `coefficient_matrix`: the coefficient matrix for the estimated regulatory effects;
